      <p>
        In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now
        uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the
        galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys\". The ragtag team aboard the spaceship
        Bebop are two such individuals.\r\nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic
        partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the
        addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh
        Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid
        Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little
        by little. \r\nWell-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western
        classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]
