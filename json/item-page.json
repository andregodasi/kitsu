On Titan he fought beside Vicious, who he admired and found encouragement in, during the war. After the war, Gren came back hoping to be a jazz musician, but that plan was cut short when he was arrested on the pretense of being a spy. In prison, Gren heard that Vicious testified against him; this and the isolation drove him mad. The prison used prisoners for drug experiments, and he was forced to become a test subject.

Spike meets her in a bar while on hunt for a explosive-smuggling criminal named Decker. After having a bar brawl with several stooges, Spike and VT seem to become fast friends until she learns Spike is a bounty hunter. Although she initially regards Spike as \"lowlife bounty hunter scum,\" she puts their differences aside and reluctantly works with him when their paths cross again as V.T. begins searching for Decker, who has performed a ship hit and run on one of her fellow truck drivers.<br><br>Her full name is largely a secret, which has prompted many to bet money and guess what her initials stand for. However, none have succeeded in winning the stack of money she's gained from numerous incorrect guesses. She is also known as the \"Heavy Metal Queen,\" for her deep love of heavy metal music, which she considers \"very soothing.\" Able to adapt to various situations, her philosophy is, \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" Considering her disdain against bounty hunters, it is believed that her husband, Ural Terpsichore, was killed, while pursuing a bountyhead. Her first name is briefly mentioned, when Spike sees her pocket watch. However, he knows her last name, due to the popularity and memory of her late husband.<br><br>(Source: Wikipedia)",
